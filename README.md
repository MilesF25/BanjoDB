## BanjoDB


Right now I am taking the security+ course and it got me thinking security (duh). It made me think of my senior project, my attempt at a quantum encrypted database. It was a cool idea but I ran into a lot of issues, some out side of my control, that ended up with me not having a finished product I am proud of. So this projet is kind of a way to make up for it.
